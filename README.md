# Academic website — Minimal theme

This is a ready-to-deploy starter for a simple academic webpage using GitHub Pages' built-in **Minimal** Jekyll theme.

## Quick start

1. Create a repository named **`your-username.github.io`** on GitHub (replace with your actual username).
2. Download this starter as a ZIP, unzip it, and upload the contents to that repo; or clone and copy the files.
3. Commit and push. GitHub will build and publish your site at `https://your-username.github.io`.
4. Edit `_config.yml` (title, description, links) and `index.md` with your content.
5. (Optional) In **Settings → Pages**, set a **Custom domain** like `www.yourdomain.com` and **Enforce HTTPS**.

### Local preview (optional)
If you want to preview locally with Jekyll:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
gem install bundler jekyll
bundle init
bundle add jekyll
bundle exec jekyll serve
# open http://localhost:4000
```

> For simple edits, you can just open `index.md` in your browser after pushing—GitHub Pages handles the theme for you.

## Customize

- Replace `assets/img/profile.jpg` with your headshot (same filename to keep the link).
- Add PDFs under `assets/papers/` and your CV under `assets/cv/`.
- Add new pages by creating `mypage.md` with front matter:
  ```
  ---
  layout: default
  title: My Page
  ---
  # My Page
  Content...
  ```
- Navigation is auto-generated by the theme (shows top-level pages).

## Notes
- Don’t commit a `CNAME` file manually unless you know your final domain. Setting the custom domain in GitHub Pages will create it for you.
- For a project site (not user site), you can use a repo with any name and enable Pages on the `main` branch. Set `url` and `baseurl` accordingly in `_config.yml`.
