I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Nuffield College, University of Oxford, where I completed my PhD in 2024. My dissertation was recently awarded the Best PhD Thesis Prize in Sociology by the European Consortium for Sociolgoical Research (ECSR).  

I study social stratification with a particular focus on the role of education. My current research examines the possibilities and limitations of school interventions in reducing inequalities in educational outcomes by socioeconomic and ethnic background. Methodologically, I specialize in causal inference methods and often employ natural experiment designs to answer questions related to school choice, teacher effectiveness, and racial/ethnic discrimination.
