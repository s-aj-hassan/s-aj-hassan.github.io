I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Nuffield College, University of Oxford, where I achieved my PhD in 2024. My dissertation recently won the Best PhD Thesis Prize in Sociology, awarded by the European Consortium for Sociolgoical Research.  

I study social stratification with a focus on the role of education. In my current research, I focus on the possibilities and limitations of school interventions when it comes to combating inequalities in educational outcomes by socioeconomic and ethnic background. Methodologically, I specialize in causal inference methods and often employ natural experiment designs to answer questions related to school choice, teacher effectiveness, and racial/ethnic discrimination.
