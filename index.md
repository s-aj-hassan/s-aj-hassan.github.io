I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Nuffield College, University of Oxford](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk), where I completed my PhD in 2024. My dissertation was recently awarded the [Best PhD Thesis Prize in Sociology](https://ecsrnet.eu/ecsr-prize-for-best-phd-thesis/) by the European Consortium for Sociological Research (ECSR).  

I study social stratification with a focus on education. My current research examines the potential and limitations of school interventions in reducing inequalities in educational outcomes by socioeconomic and ethnic background. Methodologically, I specialize in causal inference and often employ quasi-experimental designs to answer questions related to school choice, teacher effectiveness, and racial/ethnic discrimination.

    Do Refugee Children Impair the Academic Performance of Native Children in the School?

<div id="abs-refugee" class="abstract-box">
  Many European countries have examined whether the inflow of refugee children affects the academic performance of native children in schools. Using Danish administrative data and a difference-in-differences design, we find little evidence that refugee children negatively impact native peers’ educational outcomes.
